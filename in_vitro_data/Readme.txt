1. The phase contrast image obtained in in vitro culture (t = 72 h) for initial cell placement in simulation.
2. The data (Vm,vitro) obtained by PIV analysis is used for Fig 2A and S4 Fig.
3. The migration rate obtained by cell tracking is used for estimation of Vm,free.

*The data of cell density (used for Fig 2B and C) is obtained in a previous pablication.
